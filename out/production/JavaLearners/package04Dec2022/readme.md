# Strings in Java
1. Consider String as a special Variable
2. Special in the sense it will have some predefined functionalities
1. String is usually used in the situation where we want to 
store more than one character at a time
1. We can use it as an alternative to character because 
String of length 1 can be called as character.
1. **Syntax** : String variableName=value;
1. **Example** : String name="Afridi";

## Pre Defined Methods of a String
method means it has name and method brackets whereas inside
method brackets sometimes parameter/s are required and
sometime they are not required.
Method names follow a standard call *camelCases* i.e if method name is getfood , it will be
written as getFood , *mynameiskhan* will be written as **myNameIsKhan**
1. **length()** : It gives the length of String i.e
in our example if we call length() method on Afridi
it will give 6 as output.
1. **toLowerCase()**: It will convert all Characters of a String
to lowercases.
1.**toUpperCase()**: It will convert all Characters of a String to
uppercases.
1. **trim()** : It will remove Whitespaces from Boundaries.
1. **substring(start,end)** : It will return the string from start to end-1
1. **charAt(number)** : It will give the character at position equals to number
## Note : The First Character of String is at 0 not 1,Therefore if length of String is 6 then first character is at 0 position and last character is at 5th position
